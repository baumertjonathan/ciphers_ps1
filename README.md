## Atbash Cipher
The Atbash cipher is a cipher where in the alphabet is mapped in reverse so the first letter becomes the last letter, the second becomes the second to last and so on. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash)

## Autokey Cipher
The autokey cipher is a ciphere where each letter in plaintext is mapped to the [tabula recta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_recta) using a key wod or phrase [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autokey_cipher)

## Baconian Cipher
The Baconian cipher is a type of mesage encoding wherea as each letter of the plaintext is replaced by a group of five letters consisting of either 'a' or 'b'. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon%27s_cipher)

## Caesar Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter is replaced by another letter a fixed number of positions away in the alphabet. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

## Substitution Cipher
A simple substitution cipher is a cipher where each letter of an alphabet is replaced by a different letter of the alphabet provided by a key. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher)

## Rail-Fence Cipher
The rail-fence cipher is a type of transposition cipher. Each letter is taken and written in a zig zag fashion based on a numerical key, for example a message of 'hello there' with a key of 3 could be transposed as so:
```
h . . . o . . . r . 
. e . l . t . e . e 
. . l . . . h . . . 
```
which is then read from left to right providing the following ciphertext: 'horelteelh'

## Playfair Cipher
The Playfair cipher is a type of diagram substitution cipher where the key is maped to a 5x5 square filling in the rest of the alphabet afterward (typically i/j are combined) then the text is split into pairs and a series of rules determine how those letters are substituted using the diagram.
